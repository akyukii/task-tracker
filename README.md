# task-tracker
A task tracker made with React.

A front-end web app made with React components that allows for creating a to-do list with due dates and reminders. 

Backend with fetch (Put, delete, update commands) is built using a json server, functioning like a fake backend server. 
React routers (react-router-dom) was used to link to an About page.
React hooks were used (useState, useEffect) to update and fetch data from the json server.

You can download the build folder and call ```npm run build``` in your terminal. 
Then use the call ```serve -s build -p 8000``` (make sure you have serve installed on your computer).
If not, use the call ```sudo npm i -g serve``` and enter your computer password to download.
Then, your terminal should output two links, copy the local link http://localhost:8000 onto a browser of your choice (should support JS) and use!
