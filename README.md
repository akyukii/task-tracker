# task-tracker
A task tracker made with React.

A front-end web app made with React components that allows for creating a to-do list with due dates and reminders. 

A later version will have a basic backend with a json server to allow for public deploy and sign-in. Stay tuned :)

You can download the build folder and call ```npm run build``` in your terminal. 
Then use the call ```serve -s build -p 8000``` (make sure you have serve installed on your computer).
If not, use the call ```sudo npm i -g serve``` and enter your computer password to download.
Then, your terminal should output two links, copy the local link http://localhost:8000 onto a browser of your choice (should support JS) and use!
